"""Time driver for the corrected model (adapted from lfp-model's driver).

A protocol of constant-current, constant-voltage and rest steps is run with backward Euler,
each step solved to convergence by the model's Newton step. The driver is independent of the
model: it works with any *stepper*, an object with

- ``p``: parameters with the protocol fields (``steps``, ``cycles``, ``V_min``, ``V_max``,
  ``write_interval``, ``dt``, ``end_on_cutoff``, ``mass``)
- ``initial_state()``
- ``newton_step(state, h, I) -> state``: one converged backward-Euler step, or ``SolverFailure``
- ``voltage(state, I) -> float``: the cell voltage [V] (I is the total current [A])
- ``row(t, state, mAhg, I, k) -> tuple``: one output row
- ``finite(state) -> bool``
- ``limit_reason(state, I) -> str or None`` (optional): the physical limit the state has reached at current I, if any,
  used as the exit reason when a step cannot be solved (see LIMIT_* below)

Sub-steps are halved when Newton fails, voltage cutoffs are located to within EVENT_DV, and a
constant-voltage step finds its current by bracketing (see cv_step), in sub-steps if no current holds
the voltage for a whole time step (cv_advance).
